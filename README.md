AutoFileName Improved
============

Autocomplete Filenames in Sublime Text
--------------------------------------
Do you ever find yourself sifting through folders in the sidebar trying to remember what you named that file? Can't remember if it was a jpg or a png? Maybe you just wish you could type filenames faster. *No more.*

Whether you're making an `img` tag in HTML, setting a background image in CSS, or linking a `.js` file to your HTML (or whatever else people use filename paths for these days...), you can now autocomplete the filename. Plus, it uses the built-in autocomplete, so there's no need to learn another *pesky* shortcut.

Features
--------

- Display filenames and folders
- Show dimensions next to image files
- Autoinsert dimensions in img tags (can be disabled in settings)
- Support for both '/' and '\' for all you Windows hooligans

Installation
------------
To install this custom build of AutoFileName using package control<sup>[1](#pc-add-repo)</sup>

1. Open up the command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`), and find `Package Control: Add Repository`. Then enter the URL of this repo: `https://github.com/evandrocoan/AutoFileName` in the input field.
2. Open up the command palette again and find `Package Control: Install Package`, and just search for `AutoFileName`. (just a normal install)

If you want to remove this and go back to the default version of AutoFileName, find `Package Control: Remove Repository`, and select the repository to remove it. You can now reinstall the default version.

Usage
-----
**Nothing!**

For example:

If you are looking to autocomplete an image path in an HTML `<img>` tag:
```html
    <img src="../|" />
```

Pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>, will activate AutoFileName which lists the available files ready to be selected.

*Looking for an even more automatic and seemless completion?*  Add the following to your User Settings file:

    "auto_complete_triggers":
    [
      {
         "characters": "<",
         "selector": "text.html"
      },
      {
         "characters": "/",
         "selector": "string.quoted.double.html,string.quoted.single.html, source.css"
      }
    ]

With this, there's no need to worry about pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>, autocompletion with appear upon pressing `/`.
